\section{Relevium Watchful Smart Helper}

\subsection{Description and priority}
Communicate with the application through phone's built-in assistant.
\subsection{Methodology}
We create intents in the agent that map user input to responses. In each intent, we define examples of user requests that can trigger the intent, what to extract from the request, and how to respond. Generally, an intent represents one dialog turn within the conversation. The agent would match that input to its corresponding intent and return the response you defined within that intent. The agentâ€™s response usually prompts users for another utterance, which your agent will attempt to match another intent, and the conversation continues.
\subsection{Usability}
Relevium project uses  Watchful Smart Helper as a basic way to communicate with user. When the user log-in he/she will receive a welcome intent from pre-populated text responses from the responses Which has already been trained.
